This plot charts the relationship between gas prices and non-residential building construction from the beginning of the recession in 2008 until 2014. The plot shows that, afer a mutual initial dip, the two were inversely related during this time. 
In 2013, however, something seems to have occurred that caused building construction to sharply increase while gasoline prices only gradually decreased. A graph like this can shed light on what may be particular times or events of interest
in identifying economically significant events or trends. In this example the plot raises the question: What occured in 2013 to spark this sharp incline? Further data may be observed in this way in finding an answer.
