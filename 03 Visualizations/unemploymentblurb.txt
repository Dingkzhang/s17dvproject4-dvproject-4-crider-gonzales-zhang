The graph for Unemployment in US and Texas shows a strong correlation between nationwide employment rate and state employment rate. 
This details how changes in the US may have an effect on changes in the state. 
As seen from the graph, there was a sharp rise in unemployment rate from 2008 to 2009 which occurred due
to the Recession of 2008. From 2010 to 2017 onward, it shows the U.S and Texas recovering from this
period of unemployment.
