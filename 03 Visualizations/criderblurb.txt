This plot charts the relationship between gas prices and non-residential building construction from the beginning of the recession in 2008 until 2014. The plot shows that, afer a mutual initial dip, the two were inversely related during this time. 

In 2013, however, something seems to have occurred that caused building construction to sharply increase while gasoline prices only gradually decreased. A graph like this can identify or further describe economically significant events and trends. In this example the plot raises the question: What occured in 2013 to spark this sharp incline? While further analysis of other data has surely answered this question, this is a good demonstration of usefully applied data analylsis.
